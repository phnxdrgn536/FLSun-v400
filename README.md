Anyone who would like to help contribute to this GitHub whether it be with writing instructions and webdesign, to submitting their own profiles and varients, please start a discussion and request access.

  ## NOTE: Before attempting to load these profiles you should delete any V400 printer that you have already added to Cura and delete any of the original profile files
  that you installed from FLSun.
  
  Cura profile files can be downloaded by clicking <a href="https://github.com/phnxdrgn536/FLSun-v400/raw/main/cura%20Profile%20files.zip">HERE<a/><br/>
  First open Cura and choose "Help->show configuration folder"<br/>
  After downloading and unzipping drag and drop the unzipped folders into your Cura configuration foldetr. Then choose either "flsun_v400_FLSUN.def.json" <br/>
  if you have the stock firmware that was shipped with the printer provided by FLSun or "flsun_v400_Official.def.json" if you have used <a href="https://github.com/Guilouz/Klipper-Flsun-Speeder-Pad">this guide<a/> to reflash your firmware to an official build of Klipper, <br/>
  rename it to "flsun_v400.def.json and place it in your definitions folder in your Cura configurations folder.<br/>
  Once complete open Cura and enjoy!<br/>
  <br/>
  If you would rather use the Cura profile loader built for this project both Mac and Windows can be downloaded by clicking <a href="https://github.com/phnxdrgn536/FLSun-v400/raw/main/CuraProfileLoader-0.0.4.zip">HERE<a/>. <br/>
  (NOTE) Visual studio priject and source code for this loader is located in the "loader" folder of this repo.<br/>

  "Official" if you have used <a href="https://github.com/Guilouz/Klipper-Flsun-Speeder-Pad">this guide<a/> to reflash your firmware to an official build of Klipper<br/>
